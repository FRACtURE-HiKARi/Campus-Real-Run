# Campus REAL Run

[中文文档](README-zh.md) | [English Document](README.md)

This tool uses Python to simulate GPS locations on iOS devices for campus running activities. Compared to traditional location simulation tools, it provides a more stable solution.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- iOS device (requires proper driver installation, connected to computer, developer mode enabled)
- Administrator privileges (Windows-UAC, macOS-Linux-sudo)

## Todo

- [x] ~~Currently `main.py` experiences freezing after simulating location for a period of time. After inspection, this is an issue with the `lockdown start-tunnel` command. It mysteriously stops running after a certain time, though manually starting it doesn't have this issue. PRs for solving this issue are welcome.~~ Fixed.

- [x] Add functionality to automatically generate track routes.

- [x] Bilingual support.

## Important Notes

Please read the following content carefully:

- All operations require administrator privileges. Make sure to run the command prompt as **administrator**.

- If you encounter the error "[winError 10054] The remote host forcibly closed an existing connection." **First try restarting your computer and phone, and check if any proxy software is running in the background!** Please check step by step! Each one could trigger this issue! If you have proxy software, please close it!

- Although the program has implemented user-friendly operations for `start-tunnel`, `tunneld`, etc., for first-time users, we still recommend manually operating the command line (see latter part of this document) to better observe any (potential) error messages.

- What if I haven't installed drivers on Windows? I recommend using iMazing. However, I don't recommend using iMazing's virtual location feature as it cannot guarantee location stability (i.e., it will repeatedly jump between target and real locations)

## Credits

- [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3) - Python library for interacting with iOS devices
- [YimingZhanshen](https://github.com/YimingZhanshen) - added the function fluctuation of the running track, but his account has been banned by GitHub, so I modify the code for him.


## Package Installation

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pymobiledevice3
```

2. Verify installation:

```bash
pymobiledevice3 version
```

Ensure the version is 4.14.16 or higher. If not, check the [pymobiledevice3 repository](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3) for correct installation instructions.

## Features

- Supports iOS 16 and below devices
- Supports iOS 17.4+ devices (requires special initialization)
- Custom route import (supports GPX format)
- Real-time location simulation

## Usage

1. Run the program with administrator privileges:

```bash
# Windows (Administrator privileges)
python main.py

# Linux/macOS
sudo python main.py
```

2. Correct program execution steps:

- `init`: Initialize device connection

  ```bash
  run> init           # iOS 16 and below
  run> init --ios17   # iOS 17.4+
  ```

- `start`: Begin location simulation

  ```bash
  run> start [data.gpx]
  ```

- `status`: Check current status

  ```bash
  run> status
  ```

- `cleanup`: Clean up connections and processes

  ```bash
  run> cleanup
  ```

- `exit`: Exit program
  ```bash
  run> exit
  ```

## Route File Format

The program uses GPX format route files. Please refer to relevant documentation for specific format details.

I've provided a default route file `example_data.gpx`, and you can also use the `generate_route.py` script to generate custom routes.

## Important Notes

1. Must run program with administrator/root privileges
2. Ensure device is properly connected to computer before running commands
3. For iOS 17.4+ devices, use `init --ios17` command for initialization
4. Use Ctrl+C to stop location simulation at any time
5. If reinitialization is needed, use `cleanup` command first to clear existing connections

## Troubleshooting

1. If connection fails, check:

   - If device is properly connected
   - If running with administrator privileges
   - If iOS version matches initialization command

2. If location simulation fails, try:
   - Using `cleanup` command to clear connections
   - Re-executing `init` command
   - Confirming route file format is correct

## Manual Command Line Operation Steps

### Note

- If `main.py` works fine for you, you can skip this section.
- If you're using `iOS 17.3` **or below**, use the following command for `START-TUNNEL` in step 2: `python -m pymobiledevice3 remote start-tunnel`.

### Establishing Connection

1. Open command prompt with administrator privileges and run:

```bash
python -m pymobiledevice3 remote tunneld
```

Keep this window running.

If running correctly, you'll see output similar to:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [40388]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:49151 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

2. Open another command prompt with administrator privileges and run:

```bash
python -m pymobiledevice3 lockdown start-tunnel
```

If running correctly, you'll see output similar to:

```bash
2024-10-27 19:59:34 TheUnknownThing pymobiledevice3.cli.remote[16932] INFO tunnel created
Identifier: # UUID OF YOUR DEVICE #
Interface: pywintun
Protocol: TunnelProtocol.TCP
RSD Address: # RSD ADDRESS #
RSD Port: # RSD PORT #
Use the follow connection option:
--rsd #RSD ADDRESS # # RSD PORT #
```

3. Access DVT Service
   Open another command prompt with administrator privileges and run:

```bash
python -m pymobiledevice3 developer dvt ls /
```

If running correctly, you'll see output similar to:

```bash
2024-10-27 17:41:29 TheUnknownThing __main__[21244] WARNING Got an InvalidServiceError. Trying again over tunneld since it is a developer command
/usr
/bin
/sbin
/.file
/etc
/System
/var
/Library
/private
/.b
/dev
/tmp
/Applications
/Developer
/cores
```

At this point, you're 99% successful. You can now close all the windows described above, run `python main.py`, and proceed with the user-friendly operations.

### Running Location Simulation

This repository contains two main Python scripts:

1. `generate_route.py` - Generates route files in GeoJSON format
2. `main.py` - User-friendly operation, establishes connection, imports route, starts simulation

#### Generating Routes

The `generate_route.py` script creates a route with appropriate coordinate spacing. You can customize starting coordinates and distances by modifying script parameters:

Generate route file:

```bash
python generate_route.py
```

```python
# Current default values:
lon_0 = 121.426028 # replace
lat_0 = 31.025834 # replace

lon_1 = 121.426265 # replace
lat_1 = 31.024939 # replace

lon_2 = 121.427101 # replace
lat_2 = 31.0251 # replace

round_count = 3 # 3 laps around the track
```

Explanation of the above parameters:

- `lon_0` and `lat_0` are starting coordinates
- The straight section of the track is between `lon_0, lat_0` and `lon_1, lat_1`
- The curved section is between `lon_1, lat_1` and `lon_2, lat_2`; the line between these coordinates should be the diameter of the track's curve
- `round_count` is the number of laps around the track

So your running path is:

- Start from `lon_0, lat_0`
- Run along the straight section between `lon_0, lat_0` and `lon_1, lat_1`
- Run around the curve between `lon_1, lat_1` and `lon_2, lat_2`
- Run straight again, then curve again, back to start
- Repeat `round_count` times

To find coordinates for specific locations, you can use the [AMap Coordinate Picker](https://lbs.amap.com/tools/picker).

## The use of GUI file
When you go to run campus_run_gui.py as administrator, the program will first ask you to select the main.py file (which is written based on the functionality implemented in main.py), this is where you need to select the main.py file in the root directory in the dialog box that pops up. Once selected, a visualization window will appear, with functional buttons on the left (consistent with the functions and nomenclature in the main.py file).

In particular, when you click on the help button, an additional window will pop up, and clicking on the corresponding function will bring up the same explanation as in main.py.
All prompts and processes are displayed in a dialog box in the right center, and the display is consistent with the original's display in the terminal.

In the end, just enjoy it!!!
